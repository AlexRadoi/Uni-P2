# Uni-P2

Uni-P2 is a university project that uses an Atmega 164a microcontroller to control a robot with 6 DC motors for wheels, H-bridges to control them, a 6DOF servo arm, and a PlayStation 2 controller for human input.

## Usage

Once you've cloned this repository and compiled the code using AVR GCC, you can upload it to your microcontroller using AVRDUDE. Once uploaded, you can control the robot using the PlayStation 2 controller. The code maps the controller inputs to the robot's motors and servo arm, allowing you to move the robot around and interact with its environment.
